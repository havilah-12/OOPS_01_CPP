Music Store Management System using C++ and MYSQL

## Description
The Music Store Management System in C++ and MySQL is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline the operations of a music store. This project incorporates a user-friendly interface to manage various aspects of the store efficiently. It utilizes C++ for the application logic and MySQL for the database management.Aims to optimize the overall efficiency of a music store by automating routine tasks, providing insightful reports, and enhancing the overall customer and inventory management experience.

## Methodology/logic Implemented:
First, we approached this project with an idea of a music store where a customer can buy various types
and varieties of musical instruments .
This application will be managed by the admin/owner of the
music store to handle the store through modules which displays such as the items in stock, sold items, add
new instrument, remove instrument etc.
so, we gave each instrument itâ€™s id ,type ,brand, name, price and
quantity in database tables. we implemented each module and connected it with the database using global
variables and MYSQL header files. 
Thus when admin/customer makes his choice gives the input it will be
parallelly stored in database.
