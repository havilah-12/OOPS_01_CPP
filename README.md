# OOPS_01_CPP
Music Store Management System using C++ and MYSQL

## Methodology/logic Implemented:
First, we approached this project with an idea of a music store where a customer can buy various types
and varieties of musical instruments .
This application will be managed by the admin/owner of the
music store to handle the store through modules which displays such as the items in stock, sold items, add
new instrument, remove instrument etc.
so, we gave each instrument itâ€™s id ,type ,brand, name, price and
quantity in database tables. we implemented each module and connected it with the database using global
variables and MYSQL header files. 
Thus when admin/customer makes his choice gives the input it will be
parallelly stored in database.

## OOPS Concepts Used :
Exception Handling,
Inheritance,
Abstraction.
Encapsulation,
